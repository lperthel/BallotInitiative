# BallotInitiative

The Following needs to be done:

1. Calling Chat GPT programmatically to OCR the ballot initiative.
2. Checking the CSV against DCâ€™s voter database.
3. Displaying the results of the cross check in an excel sheet.
4. Highlighting in red the page numbers and names/addresses of any incorrectly OCRed entries.
