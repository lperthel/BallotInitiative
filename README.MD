# BallotInitiative

The Following needs to be done:

1. Calling Chat GPT programmatically to OCR the ballot initiative.
2. Outputting the OCR results to a .CSV document. This can be done by using a Chat GPT plugin and we would just need to edit the prompt.
3. Checking the CSV against DC’s voter database.
4. Displaying the results of the cross check in an excel sheet.
5. Highlighting in red the page numbers and names/addresses of any incorrectly OCRed entries.
6. Once the following is complete, we should compare the results of ChatGPT’s native OCR to the results of the Chat OCR plugin. Using them in conjunction may improve the overall accuracy of the app.
